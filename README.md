# 🧬 In Silico Analysis for ADAR1-Mediated Correction of Autism Variants

This repository contains a computational pipeline for identifying **autism-associated genetic variants** that could be **therapeutically corrected via ADAR1-mediated RNA editing**.  
It integrates genomic data analysis with RNA editing knowledge to pinpoint candidate variants that Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR1) might target and “fix” at the RNA level.

## 📖 Background and Biological Context

### ADAR1 and A-to-I RNA Editing
- **ADAR1** catalyzes the conversion of **adenosine (A) → inosine (I)** in double-stranded RNA.  
- Inosine is interpreted as **guanosine (G)**, effectively causing **A-to-G changes in RNA**.  
- This process prevents self-RNA from being mistaken as viral, regulating **innate immune activation** and maintaining **cellular balance**.  

### Therapeutic RNA Editing
- By pairing with a **guide RNA**, ADAR1 can be directed to a transcript to correct pathogenic variants **without altering DNA**.  
- This approach is **reversible, tissue-specific, and safer** than permanent genome editing.  
- Thousands of pathogenic **G→A mutations** (introducing an “A” in RNA) could theoretically be corrected by ADAR-driven editing.

### Relevance to Autism (ASD)
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a **neurodevelopmental condition** with strong genetic components.  
- Recent genomic studies identified **134 ASD-associated genes** with many rare pathogenic variants.  
- If these variants are **G→A substitutions**, ADAR1 could potentially **restore normal protein function** at the RNA level.
